## Examples of UDP socket communication control of Blender via Java


**Example 1**

The first example shows how to pass very basic strings between a seperate command line based Python program and the Blender Game Engine.

**Example 2** 

The Second example shows how you can effectively create and control multiple objects in the Blender Game Engine via a Java application

**Example 3** 

The last example demonstrates Java reacting in real time to user input in the Blender Game Engine. A user can move a cube and Java will make a Cyclinder object follow said cube - all via socket communication
